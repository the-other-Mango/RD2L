RD2L Cet-Sun Season 17 team review

I made a website for the season review but if you don't want to click it here is the text version.























-------------- Intro

his was my first time playing RD2L and this is my attempt at a season review of my sunday team "I hope the Indians carry us". 
I decided to do a website because I saw that one guy Dazza do it and I thought it was cool.

I had a lot of fun playing in this team, it was a chill enviroment where everyone still wanted to win. We didn't manage to pull 
off any scrims, but we still managed to get top 4 in the playoffs so I'm happy with how everything went (considering I got kicked
out first round on wednesday). I can't say for myself but I don't think anyone on the team was toxic.

Since it's pretty common I'm gonna do a review of myself but I'll let it be quick:

I found out pretty quickly that I wasn't as good at playing safelane carry as I had originally thought. I don't think I played 
carry that bad, but considering my sheet mmr which coincidentally turned out to be my peak mmr (~5450) I think I underperformed 
and had I played a safelane carry at that level we would have had a better shot at reaching the finals but it is what it is and 
I will keep spamming rubick in my pubs regardless ã‹¡.

-------------- Kevin

 Kevin is acutally not the person in the picture but he was our offlaner who ended the season with divine.

It felt like his heropool was kind of small (same for me) but I believe that could be attributed to the fact that we didn't do 
any scrims. When kevin got his pango or centaur(prenerf) he would absolutely demolish the enemy team leading to some quick 
respect bans from our opponents.

Normally you wouldn't expect too big of an impact from your offlane if they get trilaned, right? but this guy somehow ends up 
13-3 as a pangolier and the second highest networth in the game against a bloodseeker

Kevin is done with teammates throwing his games so now he carries them from the offlane, but don't pick him with 2 other 
greedy cores as he plays on the greedier side. Would want to play with him again.

-------------- Bucketbaba

Bucketbaba is a low legend and he was my laning partner for practically the whole season. Considering his mmr I would say that
bucket is a little less value but still one of the best laning partners I could have hoped for. He would ocasssionally fuck up
which was expected but playing with him was very enjoyable.

Whenever I laned with him he instantly responded if I told him to do anything this led to the enemy offlaner not being able to
abuse him. When I fucked up or anyone else on the team made a mistake he would never flame, and whenever we had a tough game
and our captain got stressed out he would take the verbal abuse from our captain without any complaints :^) .

Very chill, wouldn't mind playing with him again if he would change internet provider. 

-------------- icOnâ™¥/A/

 If Indians were pokemon Icon would be the third evolution Bucketbabababa in the Baba tree:

bucketbaba < dark eagle < Icon and Mandy being the final evolution Bucketbababababa where every evolution would successively 
gain a slightly better internet provider, PC and MMR.

I think he played ok for his mmr but unfortunately he wasn't able to play in the playoffs, despite that he cheered us on in 
the discord and flamed our opponents for trying to rig matches against us.

Would play with him again if he was able to play his games :P.

-------------- Anstar

 Anstar was our, captain, divine 5, weeb who only plays party queue and watches tournaments. Of what I remember he usually went
 even in lane even versus higher mmr players, but every now and then he would go on a killing spree. If he felt the game was 
 getting too easy after killing their mid three times he would even it out by dying three times in a row.

Anstars drafting was quite interesting, he wasn't afraid to pick unorthodox heroes like a safelane doom(which worked for his 
wed team) or a safelane bristle which I could have pulled off had I not fed. In general I feel like he is a good drafter who 
was put in a position where he had very limited options on what he could pick for us, that's partly on me since I don't know my 
own hero pool. Generally he wanted to play a fast-paced game, but he wasn't hesitant to pull out a sneaky windranger or storm 
last pick.

Since Anstar told me he is going to write a season review I'm going to leave most of the flaming to him, but this is my 
opinion of Anstar as a DotA player. As he only plays party queue he lacks in what he would learn from playing a lot of solo 
queue games, but makes up for it with game knowledge. Other than that I think he is an all around solid player, but keep in
mind that hitting creeps will bore him. Also a shotcaller.

After we got kicked out of the playoffs and the team atmosphere was a bit sour (understandably) he was still up to play a 
game of Dota underlords, despite that he is still a competetive player who would have loved to get that yellow discord name. 
Overall enjoyable captain and talking to him about DotA or his awful sleeping habits was fun ðŸ˜˜.

Biggest Idol: Envy. Going to maxbid him this mini.
